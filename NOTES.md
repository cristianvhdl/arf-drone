[Threadlocker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-locking_fluid) (also called thread or screw glue) comes in various strengths but for this situation it's a weak glue that's applied to the thread of a scew before you screw it into place, it's weak enough that you can still unscrew the screw later but strong enough that it stops the screw coming loose due to vibration (apparently its commonly used in automotive applications).

According to the [F450 user manual](http://dl.djicdn.com/downloads/flamewheel/en/F450_User_Manual_v2.2_en.pdf) you should use it for the various screws (but not for attaching the propellars).

[Loctite 243](http://www.na.henkel-adhesives.com/industrial/blue-threadlockers-medium-strength-13231.htm) seems to be suitable (UHU also have something similar, [UHU schraubensicher mittelfest](http://www.uhu-profi.de/produkte/anaerobe-klebstoffe-schraubensicherung/detail/uhu-schraubensicher-mittelfest.html), but don't seem to market it in the UK).
